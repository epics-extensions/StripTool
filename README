 This software was developed under a United States Government license
 described in the NOTICE file included as part of this distribution.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This application is based on the original stripTool program by Janet
Anderson at Argonne National Lab.  The current version was designed and
written by Chris Larrieu at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator 
Facility.

  To build, modify Makefile.Unix, if necessary, to select whether to build
on top of Channel Access or cdev.  If on top of cdev, make sure that the
$CDEV and $LIBDIR variables point to the base of the cdev distribution, and
the directory under $CDEV/lib where the libraries exist, respectively.  In
either case, make sure that $EPICS points to the base of the EPICS
distribution.  Type "make build".

  Several defaults and compiled-in values are defined in StripDefines.h.  You
might want to look in here to see if there is anything you want to change.

  Any comments or suggestions, please email me: larrieu@jlab.org
